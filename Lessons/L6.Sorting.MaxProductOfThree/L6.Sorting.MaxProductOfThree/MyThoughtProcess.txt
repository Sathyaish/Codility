After you sort the array, the possibilities are:

1) All negative elements.
2) All positive elements. Last 3 terms will yield the greatest product.
3) Two negative elements at the beginning and 1 positive at the end
4) One negative element at the beginning and the rest all positive


THEREFORE, the ALGORITHM AFTER SORTING THE ARRAY SHOULD BE:
if (last 3 terms are positive) find their product anyway. Let's calls this Last3Product.

If (first and second are negative and the last one positive)
{
	find the product of the first, second and last elements. But this may not be the answer yet.
	
	return the greater of this product and Last3Product
}

return last3Product
